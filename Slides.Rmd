## Interactive Graph

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)

data<-read.csv("FullData.txt")

ay <- list(
  overlaying = "y",
  side = "right",
  title = "CuPrice"
)

fig <- plot_ly(data, x = ~year)
fig <- fig %>% add_trace(y = ~GDP, name = 'GDP growth (%)',mode = 'lines') %>%
                add_trace(y = ~Mining.Rent, name = 'Mineral Rents (% of GDP)',mode = 'lines') %>%
                add_trace(y = ~Price, name = 'Copper Price (cUSD/lb)',mode = 'lines', yaxis = "y2") %>%
    layout(
    title = "GDP growth, Mineral Rents, Copper Price", yaxis2 = ay,
    xaxis = list(title="Year")
